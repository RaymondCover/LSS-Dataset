# LSS Dataset
The newly built LSS dataset contains 12K synthetic thermal images and 3862 synthetic thermal videos generated from COCO dataset and VID dataset by using the proposed semantic-aware image-to-image translation method as well as 969 synthetic RGB videos generated from [1] by using the video colorization method [2].
